# alpha_career(Career Guidance Management System)

DBMS project
In recent times a major issue among students is the confusion regarding which career would be best for them. Due to this dilemma, many times students take up careers that don't suit them as well as they get exhausted with their job in the long term 
So our aim is to make a student confident regarding his/her skills and guide them to take up a career that would be the best fit for him/her.
The Career Guidance Management system guides the students  through various career opportunities by first understanding his/her interest and skills by taking in various inputs and analyzing them.
